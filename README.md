# PDL-Model-Checking-Procedure
A model checking procedure for propositional dynamic logic based on the paper of Lange (2006) built on Python 3.7.2. The program first takes a Kripke structure and then checks whether or not a manually (or automatically) given formula holds.

# Running the program
Run the script 'main.py' with additional arguments specifying if you want to generate a Kripke structure from a txt file, randomly or with a specific form (a line or circle graph; these are to be used for testing the completion time). Then the user will be prompted to enter a PDL formula.
